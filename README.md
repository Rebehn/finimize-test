# finimize-test

I went for a simple design with minimal use of colour so that the sign up buttons stand out and focus the readers eye and attention. I've made the headlines and subheadings also stand out to make the text easier to read. I've added squares to give users the ability to share the article on various social media sites.

###Usage
To use make sure you have both Node and npm installed then:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Rebehn/finimize-test.git
$ cd finimize-test
$ npm i
$ nodemon
```
Then open up your browser and navigate to localhost:8000 to view.
