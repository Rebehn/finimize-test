# finimize-test

I have chosen a simple design with minimal use of colour so that the sign up buttons stand out and focus the readers eye and attention. I've also varied the sub headings and headline sizes to make them stand out and the text easier to read. I've added a row of squares to the social media buttons make them more appealing to the eye, thus giving users the ability to share the article on various social media sites. The images were added to break up the body of text and add interest to the page by highlighting the illuminated features.

###Usage
To use make sure you have both Node and npm installed then:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Rebehn/finimize-test.git
$ cd finimize-test
$ npm i
$ nodemon
```
Then open up your browser and navigate to localhost:8000 to view.
