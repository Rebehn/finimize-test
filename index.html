        <h1>Apple and Ireland Fight EU</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> What's going on here?</h4>
        <p>On Monday, both Apple and Ireland launched a formal appeal against <a href="#">recent European Union (EU) ruling</a> that Apple pay Ireland €13 billion in unpaid taxes.</p>

        <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>The EU claim centers on two of Apple’s Ireland-based subsidiaries <a href="#">through which much of Apple’s profits outside of the US were “booked.”</a> In accordance with Ireland’s tax code at the time, Apple paid the Irish government a very small amount of tax on those profits (less than 1% in some years). The EU is alleging that Ireland gave Apple a special, unfair deal. While Ireland lost out on some tax revenue, its economy has benefitted from having Apple (and other multinational companies) base their European headquarters and other operations there.</p>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Why should I care?</h4>
        <p><strong>The bigger picture: </strong><em>This case could impact the taxes of lots of multinationals.</em></p>
        <p>There are <a href="#">bout 1,000 multinationals based in Ireland</a> – many of which could be affected by the outcome of this case. Also, Ireland isn’t the only country that operates a low corporate tax regime with the aim of spurring investment within the country. More generally, the case speaks to the challenge of harmonizing national corporate tax codes within an increasingly globalized world.</p>
        <p><strong>For the markets: </strong><em>So far, this has not been a big deal for Apple’s stock price.</em></p>
        <p>It will likely take years for the European courts to pass down a final judgment. And while $14 billion is a lot of money, Apple has over $200 billion in cash, so the potential bill isn’t particularly worrisome for the company (although changes to tax policies could have a significant impact on future profits).</p>

        <h1>BP Secures Middle Eastern Oil</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> What's going on here?</h4>
        <p><a href="#">BP</a>, the massive UK-based energy company, has traded a 2% ownership stake in itself for a 10% ownership of the drilling rights to a big oil field in the Middle East.</p>

        <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>It’s a pretty simple deal: the <a href="#">United Arab Emirates</a> (UAE) is giving BP the right to drill some of its oil in exchange for shares that represent 2% of BP. It’s a deal worth about £1.8 billion ($2.2 billion) and, as a result, Abu Dhabi (the emirate that is the capital of the UAE) will become one of BP’s ten biggest shareholders</p>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Why should I care?</h4>
        <p><strong>For the stock: </strong><em>It’s about access to (cheaper) oil.</em></p>
        <p>For BP, the deal provides access to a lot of oil that costs relatively little to drill – which, given that the oil price remains half of what it was two years ago, is useful to have. Also, the expected lifetime of the oil field is about 40 years, so BP will have access to this low-cost oil for a long period of time.</p>
        <p><strong>For the markets: </strong><em>So far, this has not been a big deal for Apple’s stock price.</em></p>
        <p>BP <a href="#">recently decided</a> not to explore drilling off the south coast of Australia. Last year, <a href="#">Shell announced</a> it would stop exploring for oil in the Arctic. It wasn’t so much a win for the environmental movement as it was a consequence of the relatively low oil price. Offshore drilling, in many places, has become prohibitively expensive; it’s far cheaper to drill for oil in the Middle East or via <a href="#">shale drilling techniques</a> in, say, Texas. That, of course, has a big impact on regions that have relied on higher-cost oil production (for example, the UK’s North Sea and Canada’s tar sands).</p>
