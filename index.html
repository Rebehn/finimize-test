        <h1>Apple and Ireland Fight EU</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> What's going on here?</h4>
        <p>On Monday, both Apple and Ireland launched a formal appeal against <a href="#">recent European Union (EU) ruling</a> that Apple pay Ireland €13 billion in unpaid taxes.</p>
        <img src="https://www.finimize.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Finimize_News_Image_2016_AppleTaxes.jpg" alt="">
        <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>The EU claim centers on two of Apple’s Ireland-based subsidiaries <a href="#">through which much of Apple’s profits outside of the US were “booked.”</a> In accordance with Ireland’s tax code at the time, Apple paid the Irish government a very small amount of tax on those profits (less than 1% in some years). The EU is alleging that Ireland gave Apple a special, unfair deal. While Ireland lost out on some tax revenue, its economy has benefitted from having Apple (and other multinational companies) base their European headquarters and other operations there.</p>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Why should I care?</h4>
        <p><strong>The bigger picture: </strong><em>This case could impact the taxes of lots of multinationals.</em></p>
        <p>There are <a href="#">bout 1,000 multinationals based in Ireland</a> – many of which could be affected by the outcome of this case. Also, Ireland isn’t the only country that operates a low corporate tax regime with the aim of spurring investment within the country. More generally, the case speaks to the challenge of harmonizing national corporate tax codes within an increasingly globalized world.</p>
        <p><strong>For the markets: </strong><em>So far, this has not been a big deal for Apple’s stock price.</em></p>
        <p>It will likely take years for the European courts to pass down a final judgment. And while $14 billion is a lot of money, Apple has over $200 billion in cash, so the potential bill isn’t particularly worrisome for the company (although changes to tax policies could have a significant impact on future profits).</p>

        <h1>BP Secures Middle Eastern Oil</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> What's going on here?</h4>
        <p><a href="#">BP</a>, the massive UK-based energy company, has traded a 2% ownership stake in itself for a 10% ownership of the drilling rights to a big oil field in the Middle East.</p>
        <img src="https://www.finimize.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/BPUAE.gif" alt="">
        <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>It’s a pretty simple deal: the <a href="#">United Arab Emirates</a> (UAE) is giving BP the right to drill some of its oil in exchange for shares that represent 2% of BP. It’s a deal worth about £1.8 billion ($2.2 billion) and, as a result, Abu Dhabi (the emirate that is the capital of the UAE) will become one of BP’s ten biggest shareholders</p>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Why should I care?</h4>
        <p><strong>For the stock: </strong><em>It’s about access to (cheaper) oil.</em></p>
        <p>For BP, the deal provides access to a lot of oil that costs relatively little to drill – which, given that the oil price remains half of what it was two years ago, is useful to have. Also, the expected lifetime of the oil field is about 40 years, so BP will have access to this low-cost oil for a long period of time.</p>
        <p><strong>For the markets: </strong><em>So far, this has not been a big deal for Apple’s stock price.</em></p>
        <p>BP <a href="#">recently decided</a> not to explore drilling off the south coast of Australia. Last year, <a href="#">Shell announced</a> it would stop exploring for oil in the Arctic. It wasn’t so much a win for the environmental movement as it was a consequence of the relatively low oil price. Offshore drilling, in many places, has become prohibitively expensive; it’s far cheaper to drill for oil in the Middle East or via <a href="#">shale drilling techniques</a> in, say, Texas. That, of course, has a big impact on regions that have relied on higher-cost oil production (for example, the UK’s North Sea and Canada’s tar sands).</p>

        <h1>Trivago’s 4-Star Debut</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> What's going on here?</h4>
        <p><a href="#">Trivago</a>, the online hotel booking platform, became a publicly traded company on Friday (i.e. it completed an <a href="#">IPO</a>). But it was a bit of a bumpy ride to get there with Trivago having to sell its shares for less than it hoped.</p>
        <img src="https://www.finimize.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Finimize_News_Image_2016_Trivago.jpg" alt="">
        <h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>Trivago is actually a German company, but it’s chosen to have its stock trade in the US. Its primary business is an online hotel booking service, where it makes most of its revenue via bookings and by selling advertising space to hotels and other tourism suppliers. The optimistic view of the company is that its success will be tied to the overall growth of the tourism business and, particularly, the continuing move to online travel booking.</h4>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Why should I care?</h4>
        <p><strong>The bigger picture: </strong><em>Online travel booking is a highly competitive space.</em></p>
        <p>Trivago is far from the only online hotel booking service (in fact, its biggest shareholder is <a href="#">Expedia</a>, a giant in the space). Trivago has spent a lot of money on marketing in an attempt to grow its users and revenue. This has resulted in higher revenue but increasingly negative profits (i.e. it’s losing more money each year). Eventually, of course, it needs to turn a profit – and that’s tough in a super competitive industry.</p>
        <p><strong>For the stock: </strong><em>Investors were initially underwhelmed.</em></p>
        <p>Trivago’s shares jumped 8% above the price at which they were initially sold to investors on Friday ($11 per share). But that masks the fact that the original plan was to sell shares to investors at a price somewhere between $13 and $15. Low demand for Trivago’s shares at that price range caused the company to offer its stock at a lower price, and the IPO process went pretty smoothly from there.</p>
